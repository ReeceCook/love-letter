Project to find the optimal game for Love Letter

# Hi Ben

Lets do this in Python, cause everyone says that they can do it. Myself included but all the really mean is they followed the first 5 steps of some basic tutorial. 

https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/

^This looks really useful for learning syntax.

Yoy might want something a bit more theoteical if a lot of that doesn't make any sense.

For an IDE i'm just trying out http://www.liclipse.com/download.html

We also need to figure out how to make the whole git thing work. I should be able to link it with liclipse. Or mirror it to desktop or something. *shrugs*

# Creative direction and plan

Over all goal-
  Find out an optimal stratergy for playing love letter
  
Intial Plan-

  Make the deck.
  Randomly deal cards
  Allow for user input to pick cards
